> **Caution:** First Meaningful Paint (FMP) is deprecated in Lighthouse 6.0. In practice FMP has been overly sensitive to small differences in the page load, leading to inconsistent (bimodal) results. Additionally, the metric's definition relies on browser-specific implementation details, which means it cannot be standardized nor implemented in all web browsers. Moving forward, consider using Largest Contentful Paint instead.

**First Meaningful Paint** (FMP) is the paint after which the biggest above-the-fold layout change has happened and web fonts have loaded.  It is when the answer to "Is it useful?" becomes "yes", upon first meaningful paint completion.
